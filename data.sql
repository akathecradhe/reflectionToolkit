For Descriptors 2 and 3 there would be an increasing emphasis on the use of feedback and feed-forward approaches being routinely used to improve learning and develop learner autonomy.

They take the nature of the learning environment, the learning culture being developed, the nature and extent of the support infrastructures into account and are able to distinguish between academic and pastoral interventions.

This Area of Activity is concerned with enhancement and comprises three elements integral to teaching and supporting learning roles. Whilst the three elements might be viewed holistically it is important the elements are understood and demonstrated, particularly at Descriptors 1 and 2 to ensure successful integration. The three elements are: 1. Continuing professional development in subjects/disciplines and their pedagogy 2. Incorporating research and scholarship 3. The evaluation of (oneâ€™s own) professional practices.

Evidence should fundamentally relate to how an understanding of the nature of the subject is used to inform the design and planning of learning activities and programmes of study, the teaching strategies, the assessment and feedback. This would normally make reference to the distinctive nature, or culture, of the discipline and the particular expectations of teaching; the issues or challenges arising from the context in which teaching takes place, and the appropriate methods of delivering the subject at different levels (e.g. first year undergraduate to masters level).');

It is also concerned with acknowledging that some approaches may be more appropriate than others given the nature of the learning desired, the level of the material being taught and the readiness of students.

These processes shape academic practice and are implicit in what individuals do. Key to evidencing this area is how an individual might demonstrate engagement with feedback to enhance practice and the student learning experience. This might include an account of how they seek opportunities to obtain feedback other than relying on the institutional procedures already in place. For those working outside higher education institutional policies and practices, they will need to evidence a personal interest, understanding and commitment to quality assurance and enhancement procedures established and embedded within their practice. This will include knowledge and understanding of the quality assurance frameworks at a national level and how these are manifested at an institutional level.');

The term "diverse learning communities" might include campus based groups of students, electronic communicates, work based communities, or be defined on the basis of ethnicity, faith, social class, age etc. The practitioner needs to be able to demonstrate that they value and can work effectively with and within these diverse communities.');

It is about using the outcomes from research, scholarship and professional development to make principled, informed and considered judgements which enhance practice and the learning experience. This value advocates the importance of direct professional involvement in enquiry (in teaching and learning) to support the individualâ€™s own professional development and to enhance their teaching or learning support activities.  Evidence might include consideration and application of the findings from studies, reading, personal enquiry of (for example) teaching, learning, learners, the subject, the environment etc to enhance practice and the student learning experience. Using oneâ€™s own discipline based research to enhance the curriculum should be informed by reading or research about curriculum design, the nature of the subject itself and the learners in order to provide a rationale for the design of the curriculum and its delivery.');
